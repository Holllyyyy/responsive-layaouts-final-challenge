## My process

I wrote basic html and css reset, than I moved to write all html. I used semantic tags. One of it is header where I used for navigation menu and logo. I put inside header div. So it will handle container max-width i wrote and also display flex with class row.

In body I have few sections. First section has heading on left side and on the right side has paragraph and button.
Second section is with three paragraphs and headings who has same space between.

Than, i put main tag, who is also semantic element and inside it there is section and aside. Section should be on the left side with one paragraph picture and one more paragraph after in the larger screen. And aside element shoud be on the right side where has to be in three columns with 3 paragraphs.
On the tablet or medium size in main tag is section in column and aside is in row of three paragraphs.

For small devices, mobiles all shold be in column, what is default, to be as a block.

In the last part of this page is footer what is also semantic , and there are some headings as well as some links. Son on larger screen they are in row n columns, in small they are in columns.

About navigation menu, on large screen is used flex box where logo is left and all other is on the right side with flex-end.

On smaller devices is all with hamburger, so on click menu is opening,its on the right side , and logo is centered.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

While working on this challenge I learned :

- how to all my knowledge what I gain during this course, do use it here.
  I had few problems with what I was facing on, like if I do something for smaller view and i want to do for medium , i get conflicts most of time, so I found out what is problem and after it I fixed it. I found myself on much easier way am writing my html and css files, using flexbox on much easier way as well.
